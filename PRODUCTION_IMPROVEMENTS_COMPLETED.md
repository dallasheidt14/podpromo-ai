# Production Improvements - Completed

## Summary
All critical production improvements have been implemented to address file watcher restarts, progress tracking reliability, and frontend polling robustness.

## âœ… 1. Data Directories Moved Outside Source Tree

**Problem**: File writes to `uploads/`, `outputs/`, `logs/` inside the source tree caused file watcher restarts during development.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `backend/config/settings.py` to use environment variables for all data directories
- Added `TRANSCRIPTS_DIR` and `CLIPS_DIR` configuration
- Updated all services to use the new directory structure
- Created `backend/env.example` with both development and production examples

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/config/settings.py` - Added environment variable support
- `backend/env.example` - Added directory configuration examples
- `backend/services/file_manager.py` - Updated to use new settings
- `backend/services/preview_service.py` - Updated to use new settings
- `backend/services/clips_utils.py` - Updated to use new settings

**Usage**:
```bash
# Development (default - stays in project directory)
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
OUTPUT_DIR=./outputs
LOGS_DIR=./logs

# Production (external paths)
UPLOAD_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/uploads
OUTPUT_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/outputs
LOGS_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/logs
```

## âœ… 2. Progress Endpoint Made Fail-Safe

**Problem**: `/api/progress/{id}` could return 500 errors, causing frontend retry loops.

**Solution**:
- Created `backend/services/progress_service.py` with atomic file-based progress tracking
- Implemented proper error handling that NEVER returns 500s
- Added graceful fallback to disk-based progress inference
- Returns proper JSON responses for all scenarios (404, 500, success)

**Key Features**:
- **Atomic writes**: Uses temp files + `os.replace()` for corruption-free persistence
- **404 handling**: Returns proper JSON with "episode not found" message
- **500 handling**: Returns 200 with error status to prevent frontend loops
- **Disk fallback**: Infers progress from file existence when no progress file exists
- **Restart safety**: Progress survives server restarts

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/services/progress_service.py` - New atomic progress service
- `backend/main.py` - Updated progress endpoint to use new service

## âœ… 3. Progress Persistence Outside Memory

**Problem**: Progress was stored in memory, lost on server restarts.

**Solution**:
- Implemented atomic file-based progress persistence
- Progress files stored at `<UPLOAD_DIR>/<episode_id>/progress.json`
- Updated `EpisodeService` to use the new progress service
- Added helper methods for completion and error marking

**Key Features**:
- **Atomic writes**: Prevents corruption during writes
- **Per-episode files**: Each episode has its own progress file
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains in-memory cache for existing code
- **Error resilience**: Progress updates continue even if persistence fails

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/services/progress_service.py` - Atomic persistence implementation
- `backend/services/episode_service.py` - Integrated with progress service

## âœ… 4. Frontend Polling Improvements

**Problem**: Frontend polling didn't handle 404s and 500s gracefully, causing poor user experience.

**Solution**:
- Created `frontend/src/shared/polling.ts` - Enhanced polling service
- Implemented proper 404/500 handling with configurable retry logic
- Added exponential backoff with jitter
- Improved error messages and user feedback

**Key Features**:
- **404 handling**: Continues polling for 60 seconds after upload (episode not ready yet)
- **500 handling**: Retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff
- **Adaptive intervals**: Different polling speeds based on processing stage
- **Upload time tracking**: Tracks when upload happened for 404 decisions
- **Graceful degradation**: Better error messages and retry logic

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/src/shared/polling.ts` - New enhanced polling service
- `frontend/components/EpisodeUpload.tsx` - Updated to use new polling service
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Improved resume flow error handling

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

To verify all improvements work correctly:

### 1. File Watcher Test
```bash
# Start backend with --reload
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Upload a file and watch logs - should NOT see restart messages
# when files are written to uploads/ directory
```

### 2. Progress Endpoint Test
```bash
# Test various scenarios
curl http://localhost:8000/api/progress/nonexistent-id
# Should return 404 JSON, not 500

curl http://localhost:8000/api/progress/valid-id
# Should return 200 JSON with progress data
```

### 3. Restart Safety Test
```bash
# 1. Start upload
# 2. Stop backend during processing
# 3. Restart backend
# 4. Check progress endpoint - should still work
```

### 4. Frontend Polling Test
```bash
# 1. Upload file
# 2. Check browser console for polling logs
# 3. Should see proper 404 handling during first 60 seconds
# 4. Should see adaptive intervals based on processing stage
```

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment

For production deployment, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Production data directories (outside source tree)
UPLOAD_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/uploads
OUTPUT_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/outputs
LOGS_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/logs
TRANSCRIPTS_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/transcripts
CLIPS_DIR=/var/app-data/podpromo/clips

# Ensure directories exist
mkdir -p /var/app-data/podpromo/{uploads,outputs,logs,transcripts,clips}
chown -R app:app /var/app-data/podpromo
```

## ðŸ“Š Benefits

1. **No more file watcher restarts** during development
2. **Reliable progress tracking** that survives restarts
3. **Better user experience** with proper error handling
4. **Production ready** with external data directories
5. **Robust polling** that handles network issues gracefully

All improvements maintain backward compatibility and include proper error handling and logging.
